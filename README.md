## AI-Powered Project Evaluator Solution Summary

### What problem does your solution solve?

Our AI-Powered Project Evaluator eliminates manual grading bottlenecks, inconsistent feedback, and scalability limitations in educational assessment. Traditional evaluation suffers from human bias, delayed responses, and inability to handle diverse submission formats effectively.

### How does it work?

The system implements a 6-stage automated pipeline:

1. **AI generates customized project statements** using Snowflake Cortex with Claude-3.5-Sonnet
2. **Processes multiple submission formats** (ZIP files, GitHub repositories, documents)
3. **Performs comprehensive code analysis** including repository scraping and commit history evaluation
4. **Executes structured assessment** across standardized criteria (Code Quality 35%, Functionality 45%, Documentation 20%)
5. **Generates detailed feedback** with strengths/improvements
6. **Integrates seamlessly** with Moodle gradebooks

### What technologies did you use?

**Backend:** Python FastAPI, Snowflake Cortex, GitHub API integration, multi-format document processing. 

**Frontend:** PHP with Moodle LMS, responsive CSS Grid, progressive web features, real-time AJAX. 

**Architecture:** RESTful APIs, modular microservices, comprehensive logging, mobile-first responsive¬†design.

## Impact

60-80% grading time reduction, instant feedback delivery, scalable assessment for thousands of concurrent submissions.
